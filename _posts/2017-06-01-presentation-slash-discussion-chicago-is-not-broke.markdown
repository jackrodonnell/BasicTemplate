call-script-text: 'We are told by the mayor and a host of experts that Chicago is
  broke. They sold our parking meters. They closed 49 public schools, They closed
  six public health centers. City services are being trimmed. Public school budgets
  slashed and hundreds of teachers laid off. At the same time our property taxes and
  a host of regressive fees are rammed down our civic throats. What if Chicago were
  NOT broke? This presentation will introduce you to the authors and ideas from "Chicago
  Is Not Broke. Funding the City We Deserve." A team of civic experts have written
  short articles outlining how we can save and generate major, sustainable and progressive
  revenues to make Chicago work for EVERYONE. Tom Tresser and other authors will tell
  us how Chicago is so NOT broke. '
